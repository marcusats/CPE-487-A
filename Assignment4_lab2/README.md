# Assignment 4: Vivado Lab 2

Open Vivado and create VHDL projects to synthesize, implement, generate bitstream, and program FPGA for
1. Lab 2: Four-digit hex counter, generate and boot from a memory configuration file
2. Lab 2 modifications: Eight-digit hex counter


Program Outcome 1: (*Complex Problem Solving*)

2.3 The student will be able to develop VHDL models of systems using behavioral, structural, and dataflow concepts to describe the internal behavior and/or structure of the design.
